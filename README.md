Various helper apps to try out different things I think I'll need in a real app


In App Call Manager

1. Run an emulator, make a note of its port number (mentioend either at the top of the emulator window or in emulator settings).
2. Run the caller app in a new emulator instance and type the port number of the earlier emulator as the number to be called.
3. When the call is placed, the first emulator will receive the call and the normal process can be followed.
